# ETL Project Description

The data sets contain information about redlight cameras and traffic accidents on streets in Chicago. We will aggregate each data set by street name to obtain the total number of red light cameras and the total number of traffic accidents on each street. These aggregate data sets will be loaded into a SQL database and can be merged on street name.
